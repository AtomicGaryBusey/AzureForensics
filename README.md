# AzureForensics

This repo contains scripts I've written to aid in digital forensics and incident response processes in Microsoft's Azure cloud.

My scripts usually aren't intended to be copy/pasted and run as-is. They have configuration points you will need to define before you can use them in your environment.

### HOW TO Documents
I also find it useful to write brief HOW TO documents. These primarily remind me how to use things, but I figure they'll also help other folks. I could put these on a blog or something somewhere but that's annoying when they could just all be right here with the scripts. Por que no los dos?

### Windows-Specific Forensic Artifacts

### Windows Event ID Info
These are not just a regurgitation of the usual documentation found online. There's actual context here.

### Use of Diverse DFIR Tools
The DFIR field has a lot of good folks, and a lot of good tools available, but they do tend to be widely scattered and in various states of usefulness. As a result I frequently utilize a plethora of tools for my work, and I am not always aware of all tools that could fulfill a particular need.

Some of my scripts may involve the use of closed-source tools that require payment to access. When this is the case I will make it clear in the script. As with any script there is a lot of flexibility, so in some cases a FOSS tool I haven't used or been aware of could work well for you and you can swap it into the script.

I do want to encourage you to support the developers of your favorite DFIR tools, whether they require payment, request optional payment, or produce them asking nothing in return. Support could mean:
1. Paying them fiat currency
2. Paying them in heavy metals
3. Offering goods or labor
4. Contributing to their work (code changes, feedback, etc.)
5. Evangelizing their work within your organizations
6. Buying them a beer/coffee/tea
7. Publicly giving them a shout-out
8. Sacks of jewels stolen from the Goblin King himself

There are many ways to express gratitude! Just don't ignore the hard work put into this stuff. We all stand on the shoulders of giants and must recognize that fact. :)
